# **App Name**: LogLens

## Core Features:

- Live Log Stream: Display a continuously updating stream of log entries in real-time.
- Filtering: Enable filtering of logs based on log level (e.g., INFO, WARNING, ERROR) and source.
- Search: Implement a search bar for quickly finding specific log entries by keyword.
- Detailed Log View: Provide a detailed view for each log entry, showing all available metadata.

## Style Guidelines:

- Dark background (#121212) to reduce eye strain.
- Primary color: Teal green (#008080) for interactive elements.
- Accent color: Light ashy gray (#B0BEC5) for text and secondary elements; this color is close to analogous to green, creating good visual balance.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif for clear readability.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets.
- Use minimalist, line-style icons to represent different log levels and sources.
- Clear separation of log stream, filters, and search bar for ease of use.
- Subtle animations for new log entries appearing in the stream.
